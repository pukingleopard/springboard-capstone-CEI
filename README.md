The following files are included as part of the project submission requirements from Springboard:   
* SB-CEI-Capstone.Rmd - the "code" that performs the processing and in this case generates the report.   
* SB-CEI-Capstone.html - html version of the report   
* SB-CEI-Capstone.docx - Word version of the report   
* SB-capstone-CEI.pptx - Power point presentation with abbreviated data   

## The Problem

The client changed their licensing model in 2009 / 2010 from a traditional buy the software once and pay for upgrades to a maintenance / yearly subscription style. Since then revenue has increased significantly however, they need to understand if the revenue increase is coming from their customers overbuying licenses for the software.

## The Client

Local software company [CEI](http://www.thinkcei.com) needs to have a better understanding of their primary revenue stream in order to:
* Predict and protect against revenue shortfall risks
* Leverage and optimise revenue opportunities

## The Data

Approximately 1000-1500 invoices per year since Sept 2013 and any available client demographic data.

## The Analysis

1.  Load and clean the data. Customer information may slightly different depending on who enters the invoice or the system used so I'll have to normalize this data before anonymizing it.
2.  Anonymize the data - assign random identifiers to individual customers and any other personal information contained within the data. (nb: may not be required, data provide will be anonymous.)
3.  Identify potential other information sources that could be used to enhance the invoice data.
4.  Examine the data using exploratory analysis techniques looking for relationships among different variables.
5.  Tidy the data and using the results of step 4 apply appropriate rigorous methods to analyze the invoices.
6.  Apply visualizations and draw conclusions

## The Deliverables

An answer to the questions:
* Has a subset of clients overbought? If so, how large is the risk and what characterizes clients in that set.
* What other risks are discoverable?
* Is a subset of clients underbought?
* What other opportunities are discoverable?
* Relative performance of individual products.

Descriptive visualizations about the invoice and client data including a breakout of clients according to size.
