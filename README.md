## The Problem

The client changed their licensing model in 2009 / 2010 from a traditional buy the software once and pay for upgrades to a maintenance / yearly subscription style. Since then revenue has increased significantly however, they need to understand if the revenue increase is coming from their customers overbuying licenses for the software.

## The Client

Local software company CEI needs to have a better view into understanding their primary revenue stream in order to:
* Predict / protect against revenue shortfall risks
* Leverage and optimise revenue opportunities
