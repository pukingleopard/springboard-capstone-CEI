## The Problem

The client changed their licensing model in 2009 / 2010 from a traditional buy the software once and pay for upgrades to a maintenance / yearly subscription style. Since then revenue has increased significantly however, they need to understand if the revenue increase is coming from their customers overbuying licenses for the software.

## The Client

Local software company [CEI](http://www.thinkcei.com) needs to have a better understanding of their primary revenue stream in order to:
* Predict and protect against revenue shortfall risks
* Leverage and optimise revenue opportunities

## The Data

Invoice data from software sales spanning the years since before the change in licensing. Approximately 1000 invoices for 8 to 10 years.

## The Analysis

1.  Load and clean the data. Customer information may slightly different depending on who enters the invoice or the system used so I'll have to normalize this data before anonymizing it.
2.  Anonymize the data - assign random identifiers to individual customers and any other personal information contained within the data.
3.  Identify potential other information sources that could be used to enhance the invoice data.
4.  Examine the data using exploratory analysis techniques looking for relationships among different variables.
5.  Tidy the data and using the results of step 4 apply appropriate rigorous methods to analyze the invoices.
6.  Apply visualizations and draw conclusions

## The Deliverables

An answer to the questions:
* Has a subset of clients overbought? If so, how large is the risk and what characterizes clients in that set.
* What other risks are discoverable?
* Is a subset of clients underbought?
* What other opportunities are discoverable?
* Relative performance of individual products.

Descriptive visualizations about the invoice and client data including a breakout of clients according to size.

When exactly did the pricing change?
